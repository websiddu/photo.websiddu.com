## Santa Monica Beach
I loved the street musicians in this beach particularly the old guy (picture below) on the back of the beach deck. This beach was super happening with differing fun rides along with kids playing with pigeons.

## Hollywood Walk of Fame
Ooff!! ðŸ˜§ Too many people. This is the most craziest road I have ever been in US. People were taking pictures sitting on the sitting, lying, and rolling on the floor. And I saw some super hero characters just wandering and taking pictures with them. The street was so busy that I want not able to snap any amazing pictures.

## Universal studios
We had a chance to spend a whole day in the __entertainment capital of LA__. We went on multiple rides which were amazing. Due to the holiday season the studios were jam packed and there were some looong ðŸ˜… wait times. Anyhow in the end I managed to get some pretty good pictures with the help of my amazing friends.

## Venice beach
We spent a couple of hours walking on the beach. It's around 2 miles walk across the coast filled with street artists and small shops who don't accept cards. The art was bold, abstract, raw and mostly wowing. I think this is the most happening beach I have ever been after the Santa Monica beach. There was a helicopter observing from the sky.
