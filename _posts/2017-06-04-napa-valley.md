A friend who flew down to Bay area from Portland for the July 4th weekend. We went to a lot of places which also covered Napa. We did go to a couple of wineries and took some pictures. The overall drive was very satisfying.

## The Hess Collection Winery, CA

Fantastic scenery and museum. History of vineyards established by the Christian Brothers in 1936 is awesome. The museum pieces are very artistic and some of the art pieces.
