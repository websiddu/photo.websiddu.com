## New York, New York
This is the first time ever I visiting New York City. The city is very diverse and felt like it has a lot of history. The people here are well dressed and formal. New York has really cheap and tasty street food. Here are some of the great views of the skyscrapers from the 14th floor of Chelsea market.

## High Line, New York
The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park, greenway and rail trail. It was created on a former New York Central Railroad spur on the west side of Manhattan in New York City. Extremely pretty to watch the sunset from here!

I didn't manage to click many pictures and also I was quite annoyed as my camera took long time to process long exposure pictures. I should get a better camera ;).
